            <li>Bell peppers, sliced</li>
            <li>Onion, sliced</li>

            <li>Pasta (commonly served with the dish)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and brown them on all sides. Remove the chicken and set it aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pan, add more olive oil if needed. Saut√© minced garlic and crushed red pepper flakes until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Stir in sliced onions and bell peppers, cooking until they start to soften.</li>
            <li>Pour in white wine and let it simmer for a couple of minutes to reduce.</li>
            <li>Add diced or crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, chicken broth, and a combination of Italian herbs. Stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Return the browned chicken to the pan, making sure to coat each piece with the sauce. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat until the chicken is cooked through, and the flavors meld together.</li>
            <li>Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed. If you prefer a spicier dish, you can add more red pepper flakes.</li>
            <li>Serve the Chicken Fra Diavolo over cooked pasta, allowing the spicy tomato sauce to coat the chicken and pasta.</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh herbs like chopped parsley and grated Parmesan cheese if desired.</li>
        </ol>
