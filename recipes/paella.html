        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Paella is a famous Spanish dish originating from Valencia. It's a flavorful rice dish cooked with a variety of ingredients, such as saffron, vegetables, seafood, and/or meat, creating a delicious one-pan meal.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Short-grain rice</li>
            <li>Chicken, rabbit, and/or seafood (such as shrimp and mussels)</li>
            <li>Onion, chopped</li>
            <li>Bell peppers, sliced</li>
            <li>Tomatoes, diced</li>
            <li>Chicken broth</li>
            <li>Saffron threads</li>
            <li>Paprika</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the short-grain rice under cold water and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a large paella pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and cook until softened.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and sliced bell peppers, cooking until the vegetables are tender.</li>
            <li>Stir in diced tomatoes and cook for a few minutes until they start to break down.</li>
            <li>Add the short-grain rice to the pan, stirring to coat the grains with the vegetable mixture.</li>
            <li>In a separate pot, heat chicken broth with saffron threads and paprika. Once heated, pour the broth over the rice in the paella pan.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken, rabbit, and/or seafood on top of the rice, distributing evenly.</li>
            <li>Simmer over medium heat until the rice is cooked, and the liquid is absorbed, creating a flavorful crust on the bottom known as "socarrat."</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve the paella directly from the pan, garnished with fresh herbs like parsley.</li>
        </ol>
