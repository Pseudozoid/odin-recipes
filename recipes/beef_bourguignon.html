        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Beef Bourguignon is a classic French stew made with tender beef, red wine, and aromatic vegetables. It's slow-cooked to perfection, resulting in a rich and savory dish that's perfect for colder weather.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Beef chunks (such as chuck or sirloin)</li>
            <li>Red wine (Burgundy wine is traditional)</li>
            <li>Onions, chopped</li>
            <li>Carrots, sliced</li>
            <li>Celery, chopped</li>
            <li>Garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Beef broth</li>
            <li>Tomato paste</li>
            <li>Thyme, bay leaves, and parsley</li>
            <li>Button mushrooms</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).</li>
            <li>In a large oven-safe Dutch oven, heat butter and olive oil over medium heat. Add the beef chunks and brown them on all sides. Remove the beef and set it aside.</li>
            <li>In the same pot, add chopped onions, sliced carrots, and chopped celery. Cook until the vegetables are softened.</li>
            <li>Add minced garlic and tomato paste, stirring until the garlic is fragrant.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle flour over the vegetables and stir to create a roux.</li>
            <li>Return the browned beef to the pot, and pour in the red wine, deglazing the bottom of the pot.</li>
            <li>Add beef broth, thyme, bay leaves, and parsley. Bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot and transfer it to the preheated oven. Let it cook for 2 to 2.5 hours, or until the beef is tender.</li>
            <li>In the last 30 minutes of cooking, add button mushrooms to the pot.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve the Beef Bourguignon hot, garnished with fresh parsley, over mashed potatoes or crusty bread.</li>
